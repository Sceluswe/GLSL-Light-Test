# GLSL-Light-Test
A Light testing program for 2D textures and normal maps. The purpose of this program is to allow you to test how well your textures work with a simple GLSL light.

Download it and run the .exe.
The program will generate a new settings.txt file if it is deleted. 

# License

SFML is under the zlib/png license. You can use SFML for both open-source and proprietary projects, including paid or commercial ones. If you use SFML in your projects, a credit or mention is appreciated, but is not required.

The provided textures are samples created by Fredrik Koivukorpi.

The rest of the code is created by me and you may use it any way that you want.
